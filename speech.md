Hi. My name is Andrey Sitnik. I am frontend developer in Evil Martians
and author of Autoprefixer and PostCSS.

How many people use Stylus?
Less?
Sass?
Autoprefixer?

If you used Autoprefixer you may note, that it works not like Compass, Bourbon
or any other mixins library. It has no mixins at all. You just write selectors
and properties and it just works, like a magic.

It is because Autoprefixer is only a tip of the iceberg of entire new way
to process you CSS. Autoprefixer is just a plugin for PostCSS, tool to extend
or even replace CSS preprocessors.

We will start theory. Why we even need to compile our CSS?
Next I will tell why preprocessors did not solve our odern problems.
Next I will show how PostCSS works and how it differs from preprocessors.
And then I show a entire new things, that become possible only because
postprocessors. And does PostCSS is ready for producation usage.

So, first section. What ideas is behind PostCSS.

My scientific work was about genetics algorithms. I belive that every long-term
development is based on evolution. We have a great example of biogically
evolution in nature. We use artificial evolution in our computer science.
And of course you heard about mems, theory that even human ideas is a part
of same evolution process.

At least, it is a only long-term optimization process, that mankind knows today.

Evolution is based on three steps. Random mutation. Natural selection
in the wild. And best result inheritance.

But does we have this steps in browsers specification process? Of course,
we had a lot of inheritance. A lot of legacy code and specifications.

But does we had a selection? Mozilla was forced to support blink tag
for 19 years. It was non-standard tag working only in Firefox.

Will you afraid a mistakes, if you will support them for a decades?
